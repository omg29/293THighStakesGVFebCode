Normal Drive 
  // The first parameter is target inches
  // The second parameter is max speed the robot will drive at
  // The third parameter is a boolean (true or false) for enabling/disabling a slew at the start of drive motions
  // for slew, only enable it when the drive distance is greater than the slew distance + a few inches

  chassis.pid_drive_set(24_in, DRIVE_SPEED, true);

Normal Turn
  // The first parameter is the target in degrees
  // The second parameter is max speed the robot will drive at

  chassis.pid_turn_set(90_deg, TURN_SPEED);

Wait Until -> Change Speed 
  // pid_wait_until will wait until the robot gets to a desired position

  // When the robot gets to 6 inches slowly, the robot will travel the remaining distance at full speed
  chassis.pid_drive_set(24_in, 30, true);
  chassis.pid_wait_until(6_in);
  chassis.pid_speed_max_set(DRIVE_SPEED);  // After driving 6 inches at 30 speed, the robot will go the remaining distance at DRIVE_SPEED

Swing Turn
  // The first parameter is ez::LEFT_SWING or ez::RIGHT_SWING
  // The second parameter is the target in degrees
  // The third parameter is the speed of the moving side of the drive
  // The fourth parameter is the speed of the still side of the drive, this allows for wider arcs

  chassis.pid_swing_set(ez::LEFT_SWING, 45_deg, SWING_SPEED, 45);

Motion Chaining 
  // Motion chaining is where motions all try to blend together instead of individual movements.
  // This works by exiting while the robot is still moving a little bit.
  // To use this, replace pid_wait with pid_wait_quick_chain.
  chassis.pid_drive_set(24_in, DRIVE_SPEED, true);
  chassis.pid_wait();

  chassis.pid_turn_set(45_deg, TURN_SPEED);
  chassis.pid_wait_quick_chain();
